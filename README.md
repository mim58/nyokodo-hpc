# Nyokodô HPC

This repository contains my notes, research articles, and technical work related to my ongoing High-Performance Computing training.

It documents my journey through modern HPC concepts and NVIDIA’s developer curriculum, focusing on:

- Distributed GPU workloads
- MPI and OpenMP parallel programming
- CUDA kernel understanding and optimization principles
- CPU vector architectures (SIMD, AVX-512, SVE2)
- High-bandwidth interconnects (InfiniBand, NVLink, modern fabrics)
- Slurm cluster orchestration and batch scheduling
- Profiling and performance analysis (Nsight, perf, NVProf)
- Real-time and deterministic AI systems on heterogeneous compute clusters

This repository will grow as I progress with HPC certifications and practical experiments on AI + HPC convergence.
